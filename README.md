# reactjs-Sushant1508

This project demonstartes usage of following:

1. Both Class & Functional components
2. Hooks
3. Redux
4. Proptypes
5. Typescript (Enums & Interfaces)
6. Proper code split & tree shaking
7. CSS (Desktop responsive, but not mobile)
8. ES6 
etc.

Note: Removed eslint as it was conflicting with my prettier & vscode settings , whitelisting different scenarios would take time so removed for now, but adhered to major coding standards
